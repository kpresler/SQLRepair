# SQLSet

This part of the project contains SQLSet, our collection of SQL queries collected from a sophomore-level undergraduate computer science course.

The data is made available in two different formats:
* A [CSV file](queries.csv)
* [SQL INSERT statements](queries.sql) for populating a database.  This also includes a `CREATE TABLE` statement to build a suitable table for storing it.

Additionally, we provide information about our participants, available [here](Participant_Info.pdf).
