# SQLRepair: The Automed Repair of SQL Queries

This website is the companion to the paper `SQLRepair: The Automated Repair of SQL Queries` by [Kai Presler-Marshall](https://kpresler.github.io/) and [Kathryn Stolee](http://kstolee.github.io/).  This project contains three main components:

* SQLSearch: An activity and tool we used for collecting SQL queries from students
* SQLSet: A dataset of SQL queries submitted by students using SQLSearch
* SQLRepair: Our tool for automated SQL query repair, evaluated on SQLSet

Each section of this project contains a separate README file with further information about it
